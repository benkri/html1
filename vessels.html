                        <p>
                            The NX class was conceived in the early 22nd century as part of the NX 
                            Project at the Warp Five Complex: a research and development site on 
                            Earth, where Henry Archer, Zefram Cochrane, and Captain W.M. Jefferies, 
                            among others, worked on the creation of the warp five engine. Following 
                            the construction of the first starship of the class (Enterprise), three more 
                            NX-class starships were on the drawing board by August 2151.

                        <p>
                            The Constitution-class starships were the premier frontline Starfleet 
                            vessels in the latter half of the 23rd century. They were designed for 
                            long duration missions with minimal outside support and were best 
                            known for their celebrated missions of galactic exploration and 
                            diplomacy, and were capable of operating on five-year mission cycles.
                            <br><br>
                            The Constitution-class featured the saucer section-engineering section-warp nacelle layout common to most 
                            Starfleet vessels. All ships of the class of the same level of refit appeared to be identical at first glance, but 
                            closer inspection revealed minor detail differences on certain vessels.

                        <h2>Excelsior Class</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Excelsior class was one of the longest-serving starship 
                            classes in Federation history. It was first launched during the 
                            2280's and continued to serve as the backbone of Starfleet 
                            well into the 2370's.
                            <br><br>
                            When introduced, the Excelsior class was used to carry out 
                            Starfleet's "Great Experiment": testing a prototype transwarp drive. While the transwarp experiment ultimately 
                            failed, the design of the ship proved to be reliable and efficient. After the second vessel of the Excelsior line was 
                            christened as the USS Enterprise-B, this class would become one of the most widely recognised ship designs in 
                            all of Starfleet, favoured among many members of the fleet's admiralty.

                        <h2>Ambassador Class</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Ambassador-class featured the saucer section-engineering section-
                            warp nacelle layout common to most Starfleet vessels. It was 
                            intermediate in size between the Excelsior-class and the Galaxy-class. In 
                            addition, the class boasted at least three engineering levels.
                            <br><br>
                            A number of Ambassador-class ships were constructed with minor 
                            alterations from the original design. The saucer section's connection to 
                            the engineering hull was shifted slightly aft, with the nacelle pylon 
                            assembly moved a corresponding distance in the same direction. Cowlings were added around the Bussard 
                            collectors, making them appear closer to that of the Galaxy-class, while the impulse engine exhaust changed 
                            from a blue to a red glow. The lower sensor dome became more elaborate and closer in appearance to the
                            Excelsior-class and the deflector dish was modified. Finally, the width of the shuttlebay was increased and a 
                            second facility resembling that on the Excelsior-class engineering hull was mounted directly underneath the 
                            original one. Graphics were upgraded with the Starfleet insignia of the 2360s.

                        <h2>Galaxy Class</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Galaxy class was introduced in the 2350's and was one of the 
                            largest and most advanced starship designs in Starfleet history. 
                            These ships served a number of purposes including exploration, 
                            defense, diplomatic missions and support and rescue operations.
                            <br><br>
                            The Galaxy class starships were also suited for accomodating 
                            civilians long-term and housed a wide variety of facilities not often 
                            found on other starships. These included a gymnasium, a racquetball court, a bar and restaurant, a concert hall, 
                            educational facilities and sixteen holodecks.
                            <br><br>
                            This model of starship was designed with two distinct hull sections, the saucer section (primary) and the 
                            stardrive section (secondary). In extreme scenarios, the saucer could separate from the stardrive section and 
                            operate independently, though could only travel at impulse. In the event of a possible warp core breach, the 
                            crew could evacuate to the saucer section which would then separate from the stardrive section before the 
                            engine core exploded.
