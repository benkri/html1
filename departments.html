                        <h4>Starfleet Academy</h4>
                        <p>
                            As early as the original Star Trek, 
                            characters refer to attending Starfleet Academy. 
                            Later series establish it as an officer training 
                            facility with a four-year educational program. 
                            The main campus is located near Starfleet Headquarters 
                            in what is now Fort Baker, California.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Command</h4>
                        <p>
                            Starfleet Command is the headquarters/command center of Starfleet. 
                            Its headquarters are depicted as being in Fort Baker, across the 
                            Golden Gate from San Francisco. Overlooking the Command from the 
                            other side of the Golden Gate is the permanent site of the Council 
                            of the United Federation of Planets in what is now the Presidio of San Francisco.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Shipyards</h4>
                        <p>
                            Starfleet's ships are built on Mare Island near San Francisco. 
                            Located on San Francisco's Mare Island, with additional starship assembly 
                            facilities located in Earth orbit, Starfleet's San Francisco Navy Yards 
                            is the site where the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 was built in 2245. Captain Robert April, 
                            the Enterprise's first commanding officer, was present at the San Francisco Navy Yards 
                            when the vessel's major components were built and prepared for assembly in Starfleet's 
                            orbital drydock facilities.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Engineering Corps</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Starfleet Engineering Corps (also called the Starfleet Corps of Engineers) is 
                            in conjunction with projects such as hollowing out the underground laboratory complex inside 
                            the Regula I asteroid, the design of the Yellowstone-class Runabout, and devising a defense 
                            against the Breen energy-dampening weapon. As a result of these successes, Starfleet engineers 
                            have gained a reputation as the undisputed masters of technological adaptation and modification.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Intelligence</h4>
                        <p>
                            Starfleet Intelligence is an intelligence agency of the United Federation of Planets. It is 
                            entrusted with foreign and domestic espionage, counter-espionage, and state security.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Judge Advocate General</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Starfleet Judge Advocate General (or JAG) is the branch charged with overseeing 
                            legal matters within Starfleet. A court-martial may be convened in the absence of any JAG 
                            officers by three presiding command-level officers. The loss of a starship automatically 
                            leads to a JAG court-martial. The Captain has the authority to conduct a court-martial on the ship, 
                            given the circumstances of the ship being isolated from the Federation.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Medical</h4>
                        <p>
                            Starfleet Medical is the medical branch of Starfleet.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Starfleet Tactical</h4>
                        <p>
                            Starfleet Tactical is responsible for planning defensive strategies as well as weapons research and development.
