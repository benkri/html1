<!--Improvements!
    1. I implemented a responsive layout design for at least two different widths for each page, 
    a couple pages more than two different widths (index.html and vessels.html). Those implementations 
    include differences in heading sizes at very small screen widths, padding differences at smaller 
    screen widths in the <article> section of each page so that it wouldn't always be an awkward 
    gap on the sides of the container, and difference in image placement on index.html and vessels.html 
    to accomodate the smaller screen widths (placed the images below the text sections).
    2. I figured out how to turn the <article> section of vessels.html into a proper grid that 
    flowed naturally underneath the <header>!! I'm so excited that it worked outâ€”it was stupidly 
    simple, I just placed it inside the <article> section and since it was a completely different 
    section than the <header> instead of just being different <div> sections, it worked. FUNNY.
    3. I made an external CSS for each webpage instead of it being internal.
    4. I made the <nav> tag nest within the <header> to imitate the tag that normally goes with 
    links on a webpage, as opposed to being a regular section with no links like it was before.
    5. I titled the homepage index.html like it's supposed to be.
