                            to boldly go where no man has gone before.

                            This message has been the Starfleet motto since the stardate 8.8.1966, with our very first 
                            and historically most successful travelling starship the U.S.S. Enterprise representing each 
                            other travelling starship. Starfleet's interest is in the betterment of the universe we live in, 
                            which primarily includes representing the human race and each cooperating race as equals, bringing peaceful 
                            terms to each intergalactical interaction whenever possible, and protecting the life we serve in each 
                            galaxy we are established in. Starfleet has no tolerance for violations of the interests that we hold 
                            in such high regard, as it would bring disrespect to the freedom that each life deserves.<br><br>
                            If anyone is interested in joining and upholding Starfleet and its mission, please visit our 
                            Academy Page, as it is the first step into becoming a great addition to Starfleet.
